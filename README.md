Planned for Development:
  - Basic player's character movement including walking, running, jumping
  - At least 3 levels
  - At least 1 simple upgrade station or shop
  - Main menu, options menu, save & load/continue, and volume control
  - Music and SFX
  - At least 2 kinds of collectables
  - At least 2 mobility upgrades

Design Goals:
  - Comfotable, fun mobility
  - Satisfying collectables
  - Fun mobility upgrades
  - Exciting and delightful visuals (but let's be realistic)

Delagation of Labor:
  - Weston is pretty much doing everything and not getting paid. :S

Brainstorming:
  - Recoloring pandas
  - Fast bursts of movement
  - High jumps
  - Multi-jumping
  - Flashy collectables
  - Collectable magnets? Look into effectors
